### How to Use it?
In the images folder inside the src folder, create a .txt file with the base64 String. Then in the Main class Change the String inside the new <strong>FileReader("src/images/chosen-file.txt")</strong> to the chosen file you want to open. After that just run the project and you are good to go!
